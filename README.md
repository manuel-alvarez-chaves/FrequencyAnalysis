# Frequency Analysis

Notebooks and scripts to perform frequency analysis of water resources related data (mainly precipitation and streaflow).

Will document further as the project is realized but, the main idea is to fit maximum yearly precipitation or streamflow data series to the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution and generate plots on the fit of the distribution as well as estimate for design values for several return periods. A 90% confidence interval will be computed using a parametric bootstrap.
